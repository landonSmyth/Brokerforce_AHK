This is a friendly reminder that we have not yet received the completed renewal questionnaire.

Please complete the attached questionnaire. Send it in along with copies of the latest financial statements and list of Directors and Officers at the Church. If the financials are not yet available, please send the questionnaire separately for the time being and let me know when the financials are expected to be ready/finalized. 
 
The renewal questionnaire is a requirement from the Insurance Co., and will be requested every year in order to assess changes in the insurance needs of the church. This keeps us aware of the needs of churches for their coverage and limits. Our office does get audited, and the questionnaire needs to be present in your file. 

Additionally, as you have abuse liability coverage you are required to complete the abuse application section this year (Questions 16-23 on the questionnaire).

The insurance company is doing a review and needs to make sure that their clients with abuse coverage are following all requirements to continue qualifying for an increased abuse limit.

Questions 16 – 22 on the application are the requirements that need to be included in your protocol and followed. To confirm that they are being followed, we will need you to return the form with the responses answered “yes” (excluding question 17 items 2&3).

Please let me know if you have any questions.
