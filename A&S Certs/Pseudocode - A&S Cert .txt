/Must create a key to unpause because some clients 
have a pdf named identical to the word doc 
Hover over/highlight the correct doc and then resume 
Another option would be to make a different hotkey for REFERRAL 
clients, it seems that the pdf thing only happens with Lisa clients

/This will have to be done manually because 
some clients will have a 202# cert and some 
will have one without a year if they are a new client 

Could also just make two identical hotkeys but the 
second one is suited for new clients 
	-> Worth the saved time on the majority of clients that are 202#
