-If the date you are sending is less than 30 days before renewal:

	Ex if delayed 2 weeks, add two weeks to the first payment date but keep 2 and 3 1 and 2 months away from actual renewal date

Notes:
JESUS-5 is a credit refund example (2022) 
If the client has A&S, the renewal letter template usually adds an extra blank page unintentionally
Need to check and ensure that the renewal letter is 2 pages only and delete the blank page if needed
