## Brokerforce AutoHotkey Scripts
---
From May 2022 to May 2024 I worked for Brokerforce Insurance Inc. as a Technical Service Representative. Many of the day to day tasks I would be working on were incredibly manual, so I taught myself AutoHotkey v1 and made many scripts for the various workflows to greatly increase my productivity and reduce my human error. 

These scripts are all written for AutoHotkey version 1, and will not work properly on v2 due to syntax changes between versions and certain function deprecations. Future work may include adapting the scripts to work with version 2 and/or making copies of these scripts in python with the use of the `ahk` module (https://pypi.org/project/ahk/).
