---------------Notes and Dependencies---------------
-The program when filling out the email deletes the first attachment, which is usually the policy document.
Other attachments like an A&S cert or a cert copy would need deleted manually but at least it can automatically 
delete one of them. If this is used on a renewal that does not have the policy as the first document it will delete 
the first attachment regardless
