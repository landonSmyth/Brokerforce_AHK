Updating Epic using prospect list:

Goal: updating the information in the prospect list such as name and/or address, removing
any churchs that are no longer prospects (not operating anymore) and revising any mistakes or input
errors in epic

Steps:
-Open the prospect list and the CRA search
-Search up the highest row church by their client name in Epic
-Open to account detail 
-Copy the name and search it in CRA 
	-> Might be best to have the Status in CRA as "All" instead of registered 
-If you do not find the church:
	-try search using the "All" filter on status
	-if you still do not find it, highlight yellow in rate sheet
-If you find the church but it's charitable status is revoked:
	-try to deactivate the client by using "Actions" > "Inactivate/Deactivate" > reason "No longer in business"
	and remove it from the excel prospect sheet
	-If you cannot deactivate it for whatever reason, highlight the row blue
-If you find the church but the name is slightly or very different
	-search Epic for that name and see if it is already in there. If it is, mark the client you are doing yellow
	because you could not find them
	-if the client is not in epic, update the name of the church 
-If you do find the church, open its "Charity Detail" page 
-Type out the full name in account detail 
-Revise the address to be no-caps in the address part of account detail 
	-> Type out things like "St" as "Street", "Cres" as "Crescent", "Blvd" as "Boulevard"
-Copy the capital-case church name 
-Double check while you are in account detail that the type of business is commercial
	-> if it is personal, change it to commercial and update the contact(s) accordingly by adding
	a new business contact and deleting the Personal contact. Leave the Category as "Both Contact & Policy"
-Go to contacts and paste the non-caps name in the primary contact
	-> it should already be using the address as the main address but if it is not, check that box
-Delete that client's row from the prospect report
-Finish

Common Anomalies:
-If you find a client in CRA with matching name/City but the address is different, update the client and address. 
if the city is different, highlight on the sheet Purple
-If you find a client with a revoked charitable status, only deactivate if it is a complete match. 
If there is something different like name or address, mark Blue in the sheet 
-If you fin a client in CRA that has a slightly different name than what is in Epic, update it. If the name
is significantly different, do not consider them the same and mark as yellow for "not found in CRA". 
Example: "Church of Christ" in Epic and "Church of Christ, Red Deer" are the same so update it 
-Address directions such as S, NE, SW, should not be typed out, leave them as is 
-If the address of the client has a unit number, update Epic to match whatever is listed in CRA
-If a church is incorporated and it is in their legal name, follow the naming convention in CRA. 
-For address that have RR in them, the naming convention is "RR #1", meaning the address would be written like
"123 Test Street, RR #1
-If there is Highway in the address, the naming convention is "Highway #7". 
-If you see "General Delivery", do not omit it from the address. Add it in where it shows in CRA or in Epic originally
-If you see something like "U#C44", make it "Unit C44"
-If there is a PO box address that has a street originally in Epic but only the PO Box in CRA, omit the street address
